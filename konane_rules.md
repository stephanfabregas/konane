Konane Rules
============

Players
-------
2

Equipment
---------
### Game Board

10-row by 10-column and 6-row by 6-column boards are available. Other dimensions, including rectangular boards, may also be used, as long as there are an even number of rows and columns.

### Stones

Stones of two colors are used, one color for each player. Each player has enough stones to cover half the spaces on the board.

Objective
---------
To be the player to make the last legal move.

Setup
-----
Each player is assigned control of a stone color by agreement.

Stones are set up in a checker pattern (alternating colors) covering the entire board. Each player then selects one stone of their color from one of the four spaces at the center of the board and removes that stone from play.

Turn
----
The player in control of the darker stones makes the first move.

A legal move involves a player taking one of their stones and jumping over an opponent's stone to an adjacent empty space. Moves may not be made in a diagonal direction. If another stone may be jumped using the same piece along the same direction, the player may choose to make another jump, but is not compelled to do so. All stones jumped over in this manner are removed from play.

Scoring
-------
Captured stones do not score points. No score is kept during game play.

Winning
-------
The player who is able to make the last legal move is the winner of the game.
