Konane Board
============

This is a game board for the traditional Hawaiian Board game [Konane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konane). 10-row by 10-column (450-mm by 450-mm) and 6-row by 6-column (420-mm by 279.4-mm) versions are available.

Both .svg (made with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)) and printable .pdf versions are available. The 6-row by 6-column version is printable on standard 11"x17" (tabloid) and size A3 paper.

Standard size Go game pieces (~22-mm diameter) are intended to fit this board, but any set of appropriately sized stones in two colors will do.

See the rules for more details on equipment and game play.
